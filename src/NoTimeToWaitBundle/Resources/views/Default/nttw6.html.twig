<h2>The No Time to Wait Conference</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.beeldengeluid.nl/">Netherlands Institute for Sound &amp; Vision</a> shall host the sixth No Time to Wait conference at its <a href="https://denhaag.beeldengeluid.nl/en/mediamuseum/">media museum in The Hague</a>. No Time to Wait is a FREE three-day conference focused on <em>open media</em>, <em>open standards</em>, and <em>digital audiovisual preservation</em> managed by <a href="{{ path('homepage') }}">MediaArea.net</a>. No Time to Wait has always been a conference that blends in-person and online participation and this year we shall work to emphasize online participation in response to the social, travel, and financial restrictions related to the pandemic.</p>
<p>This year's theme is <em>Transparency, Teaching &amp; Trust</em>. Sharing open source solutions, contributing to open standards, and maintaining open workflows, can build a participatory, responsive, and sustainable foundation against the challenges of audiovisual preservation work. However, if funders, managers, supporters, and the communities we support don't understand what's at work, then skepticism, confusion, or exclusion can enter the environment. At this year's No Time to Wait we focus on cultivating <em>Transparency, Teaching & Trust</em>, working in a way that is sensible to onlookers, advocating for open solutions, and the challenge to sustain and evolve workflows that consider the perspectives of all involved.</p>

<h2>What's the Word About No Time To Wait</h2>

<p><i>No Time to Wait 2 was a strong statement in regard to the increased and enormously productive collaboration between film and media archivists and developers. It opened up a perspective for digital film preservation pathways and practices that are based on open standards, open source software, and business models which balance openness and the avoidance of vendor lock-in with plannability and adequate financial reward for developers.</i><br>
-- Michael Loebenstein, Österreichisches Filmmuseum | Austrian Film Museum</p>

<p><i>No Time to Wait 3 was an inspiring event, bringing together a dynamic community of a/v archivists, developers and digital preservationists in a friendly atmosphere to facilitate open collaboration, information exchange,  debate and consensus-forming. Attendees left with an invaluable network of supportive contacts as well as heads and laptops bursting with new ideas, resources and approaches to the challenges of moving image preservation. More than any similar event I’ve attended, the NTTW series operates like a vitamin injection of enthusiasm, energy and inspiration to face the work ahead!</i><br>
-- Stephen McConnachie | Head of Data and Digital Preservation | British Film Institute</p>

<p><i>No Time To Wait 4 at Blinken OSA brought together a super curious, enthusiastic crowd of moving image, sound and photo archivists; code writers/developers; and digital preservation experts in the open source universe, from freelancers to small and large institutions.<br/>
The healthily mixed group presented and discussed finished projects, bringing forward knowledge and skillsets, and best practices, to facilitate sharing of ideas. NTTW is about exchange and open debate. The most popular part of conference was the "solve the puzzle": glitches, asynchronous moving image were played, and through comments from the crowd, the technical errors were named, and solutions were suggested.<br/>
NTTW is the most open, inspiring, and motivating A/V event, with its lack of pretention and truly inclusive spirit. After NTTW4 many of us is to look at their own A/V projects with renewed energy, ideas for solutions and dedication to our wonderful cultural heritage-related work.</i><br/>
-- Zsuzsanna Zadori, Senior Audio-visual Archivist, Blinken Open Society Archives</p>
