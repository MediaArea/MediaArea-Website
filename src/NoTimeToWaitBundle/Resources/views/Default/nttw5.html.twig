<h2>What's the Word About No Time To Wait</h2>

<p><i>No Time to Wait 2 was a strong statement in regard to the increased and enormously productive collaboration between film and media archivists and developers. It opened up a perspective for digital film preservation pathways and practices that are based on open standards, open source software, and business models which balance openness and the avoidance of vendor lock-in with plannability and adequate financial reward for developers.</i><br>
-- Michael Loebenstein, Österreichisches Filmmuseum | Austrian Film Museum</p>

<p><i>No Time to Wait 3 was an inspiring event, bringing together a dynamic community of a/v archivists, developers and digital preservationists in a friendly atmosphere to facilitate open collaboration, information exchange,  debate and consensus-forming. Attendees left with an invaluable network of supportive contacts as well as heads and laptops bursting with new ideas, resources and approaches to the challenges of moving image preservation. More than any similar event I’ve attended, the NTTW series operates like a vitamin injection of enthusiasm, energy and inspiration to face the work ahead!</i><br>
-- Stephen McConnachie | Head of Data and Digital Preservation | British Film Institute</p>
