<h2>Our Conference Program</h2>

<p>We are pleased to announce our preliminary program is now available at <a href="https://bit.ly/nttw4program">https://bit.ly/nttw4program</a>. Thanks so much to our contributors, moderators, and panelists.</p>

<h2>Workshop</h2>

<p>An optional workshop/codeday will be offered for conference attendees which will occur the day before the conference on Wednesday, December 4, 2019.</p>
<p>The workshop is now at capacity.</p>
<p>This day will be structured as an "unconference." Please bring ideas about what you would like to learn or do. At the start of the day, attendees will go over what they want to get out of the day. Then, attendees will break into small groups and work together towards this goal. At the end of the day, each will share their results and progress.</p>

<h2>Registration</h2>

<p>Conference registration is now closed as we have reached our capacity. Any cancelled registrations will be offered to our waiting list. In order to register as a remote registrant or to join our waiting list, please complete our <a href="http://bit.ly/nttw4signup">registration form</a>.</p>
<p>As with all No Time to Wait conferences the registration will be free; however, there are many associated costs in putting on this event. If you are registering, please consider supporting our work and contributing by becoming a <a href="https://mediaarea.net/SupportUs/Individual">MediaArea sponsoring member</a>.</p>

<h2>Volunteering</h2>

<p>No Time to Wait continues as a free registration event, thanks to our sponsors and to our volunteers. Volunteers help coordinate the stage and onsite registration, contribute designs, record and stream the conference, and represent remote participants. If you would like to volunteer, please sign up for a volunteer opportunity at <a href="https://bit.ly/nttw4volunteer">https://bit.ly/nttw4volunteer</a>.

<h2>Remote Attendance</h2>

<p>We strive to make the event accessible for remote attendance. We will be publishing information on how to stream and remotely participate in the event live. For all sessions we will have a designated onsite representative of remote participants (inspired by the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7649">Jabber scribe role defined by IETF</a>), so that if you’d like to ask a question to a speaker and request clarification from someone onsite, there will be a designated person in the room that will monitor the chatroom and support remote attendees. To sign up as a remote participant, please use the same registration <a href="http://bit.ly/nttw4signup">form</a> and select "Remotely" in the form.</p>

<h2>Travel Grants</h2>

<p>As done at past No Time to Wait conferences, we are offering travel grants to potential attendees that may need support. Thanks in particular to <a href="https://reto.ch/">AV Preservation by reto.ch</a>, for sponsoring these travel grants.

<h2>What's the Word About No Time To Wait</h2>

<p><i>No Time to Wait 2 was a strong statement in regard to the increased and enormously productive collaboration between film and media archivists and developers. It opened up a perspective for digital film preservation pathways and practices that are based on open standards, open source software, and business models which balance openness and the avoidance of vendor lock-in with plannability and adequate financial reward for developers.</i><br>
-- Michael Loebenstein, Österreichisches Filmmuseum | Austrian Film Museum</p>

<p><i>No Time to Wait 3 was an inspiring event, bringing together a dynamic community of a/v archivists, developers and digital preservationists in a friendly atmosphere to facilitate open collaboration, information exchange,  debate and consensus-forming. Attendees left with an invaluable network of supportive contacts as well as heads and laptops bursting with new ideas, resources and approaches to the challenges of moving image preservation. More than any similar event I’ve attended, the NTTW series operates like a vitamin injection of enthusiasm, energy and inspiration to face the work ahead!</i><br>
-- Stephen McConnachie | Head of Data and Digital Preservation | British Film Institute</p>
