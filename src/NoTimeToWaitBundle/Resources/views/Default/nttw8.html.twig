<h2>The No Time to Wait Conference at ZKM | Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe</h2>

<p>The »No Time to Wait« conference is back for its eighth edition, taking place from September 11 to 13, 2024 at the ZKM | Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe.</p>

<p>»No Time to Wait« is a three-day conference dedicated to exploring open media, open standards, and digital audiovisual preservation. Organized by ZKM and MediaArea.net, this event is part of a conference series and represents the eighth installment since its inception in 2016. This event follows ZKM’s “Just in Time” conference (2022) on the status quo and future of electronic art preservation, ZKM is honored to host the »No Time to Wait« in 2024.</p>

<h2>About Our Host</h2>

<p>Founded in 1989, ZKM occupies a unique position in the global museum landscape with its commitment to electronic and digital arts. ZKM boasts a collection of over 12,000 works, including 100 video and audio installations, 1,500 videos, and 240 computer-based installations. These digital works, created between 1979 and 2022, make ZKM's collection one of the most extensive in the world for computer-based installations. In addition to the collection, the institution has acquired numerous artist archives, comprising over 23,000 videos, approximately 440 films, and 6,400 sound recordings. Aligned with its mission not only to support artists in their exploration of new technologies but also to safeguard the history of new media for future generations, the ZKM  has thus developed recognized expertise in the preservation of electronic and digital works.</p>

<p>Over the past decade, the invaluable contribution of museum outsiders to the work of preservation and the exchange with other communities has proven to be a game changer in the care for these complex and fragile artworks. Hosting the »No Time To Wait« conference acknowledges these communities and serves as an example of the porosity between the world of archivists, film and art preservationists, and software developers.</p>

<h2>What's the Word About No Time To Wait</h2>

<p><i>No Time to Wait 2 was a strong statement in regard to the increased and enormously productive collaboration between film and media archivists and developers. It opened up a perspective for digital film preservation pathways and practices that are based on open standards, open source software, and business models which balance openness and the avoidance of vendor lock-in with plannability and adequate financial reward for developers.</i><br>
-- Michael Loebenstein, Österreichisches Filmmuseum | Austrian Film Museum</p>

<p><i>No Time to Wait 3 was an inspiring event, bringing together a dynamic community of a/v archivists, developers and digital preservationists in a friendly atmosphere to facilitate open collaboration, information exchange,  debate and consensus-forming. Attendees left with an invaluable network of supportive contacts as well as heads and laptops bursting with new ideas, resources and approaches to the challenges of moving image preservation. More than any similar event I’ve attended, the NTTW series operates like a vitamin injection of enthusiasm, energy and inspiration to face the work ahead!</i><br>
-- Stephen McConnachie | Head of Data and Digital Preservation | British Film Institute</p>

<p><i>No Time To Wait 4 at Blinken OSA brought together a super curious, enthusiastic crowd of moving image, sound and photo archivists; code writers/developers; and digital preservation experts in the open source universe, from freelancers to small and large institutions.<br/>
The healthily mixed group presented and discussed finished projects, bringing forward knowledge and skillsets, and best practices, to facilitate sharing of ideas. NTTW is about exchange and open debate. The most popular part of conference was the "solve the puzzle": glitches, asynchronous moving image were played, and through comments from the crowd, the technical errors were named, and solutions were suggested.<br/>
NTTW is the most open, inspiring, and motivating A/V event, with its lack of pretention and truly inclusive spirit. After NTTW4 many of us is to look at their own A/V projects with renewed energy, ideas for solutions and dedication to our wonderful cultural heritage-related work.</i><br/>
-- Zsuzsanna Zadori, Senior Audio-visual Archivist, Blinken Open Society Archives</p>
